## Abstract:

**Stock price prediction** is a challenging task in the financial domain, driven by the complex and dynamic nature of markets. Traders, investors, and financial analysts employ a range of techniques to make informed decisions about buying or selling stocks. The goal is to capitalize on potential price changes and market opportunities.
For Stock prediction, various **time series models** play a crucial role in capturing patterns and trends within historical stock price data. 
This abstract provides an overview of different time series models commonly employed in stock prediction.

### AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA):
ARIMA models are widely utilized for their ability to capture temporal dependencies and seasonality in time series data. By combining autoregressive and moving average components, ARIMA models are effective in forecasting stock price movements.

### Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH):
GARCH models focus on modeling volatility clustering and changes in variance over time. These models are particularly useful for understanding the intricate dynamics of stock market volatility, aiding in risk assessment and management.

### Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM):
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional RNNs in capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data.

### XG-BOOST:
XGBoost, short for eXtreme Gradient Boosting, is a popular and powerful machine learning algorithm that belongs to the class of ensemble learning methods. It has gained widespread popularity and has been successful in various data science competitions, making it a go-to choice for predictive modeling tasks. XGBoost is particularly effective for structured/tabular data and has been used in a variety of applications, including regression, classification, and ranking.
 
 
 
## Structure of the Projects 📝
This repository consists of various machine learning projects, and all of the projects must follow a certain template. I wish the contributors will take care of this while contributing to this repository.

**Dataset** 
+ This folder stores the dataset used in this project. If the Dataset is not being able to upload in this folder due to the large size, then put a README.md file inside the Dataset folder and put the link of the collected dataset in it. That'll work!
+ Dataset can be scrapped from web sources for real-time analysis of stock price. ** [Stock_prediction_model_starter_notebook] **

**Model**
+ This folder would have your project file (that is .ipynb file) be it analysis or prediction.

**Dashboard**
+ A finance dashboard is an interactive web application that provides real-time insights into stock prices. It fetches live data from financial markets, processes it, and presents it in a user-friendly format. ** [Starter_python_file_streamlit.py] **  

The dashboard may include features such as:

+ **Stock Selection**: Allows users to select the stocks they are interested in.
+ **Price Charts**: Displays the historical price trends of selected stocks.
+ **Real-Time Price Updates**: Shows the current price of the selected stocks, updated in real-time.
+ **Performance Metrics**: Provides key metrics such as opening price, closing price, highs, lows, and volume traded.
+ **Predictive Analysis**: Uses machine learning algorithms to predict future price trends.
